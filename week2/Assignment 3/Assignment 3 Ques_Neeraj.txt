Ques1  What are the conditions and loop in java.What is the difference between for loop and while loop.

Ans 
Conditions- define set of rules to execte method body 
1. if -Method body will be executed if a specified condition is true
2. else- Method body will be executed if the same condition is false
3. else  To check for a new condition, if the first condition is false
4. switch to check multiple condition.

Loop- It is used to execute a set of instructions repeatedly 

For Loop- It is used when we have fixed number of iterations.
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do while loop
	
Syntax
for(init;condition;incr/decr){  
-------body--------
}
Example- for(int i=0; i<=20; i=i+1)
{
System.out.println("Hello Java Program");

}


While Loop- It is used when we don not have fixed number of iterations.

Syntax
while(condition){  
p---------body------------
}

Example- 
int x=1
while(x<10)
{
System.out.println("Hello Java Program");
x++
}



Ques 2 What is an object in java and how to create an object. What is the difference between object,class and methodsin java.

Ans  It is real world entity which has state and behaviour property.
     
Objet is created from a class using new keyword

Example-Test T1 = new Test();



Class- A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.
Declartion- Each word should start with uppercase

Signature of a Class
Access modifier  Class keyword  Class Name


Object-  It is instance of a class  which has state and behaviour property.


Method-Method describes behavior of an object. A method is a collection of logical block that are grouped together to perform an operation
Declartion- Start letter of first word will be in lower case and starting letter of other words should be in Upper case.

Signature of a method
Access modifier  Static/Non static  Return type  Method Name  (prameters)
